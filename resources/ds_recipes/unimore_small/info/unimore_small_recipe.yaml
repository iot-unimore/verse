# set is a collection of scenes that will be grouped in a subfolder (same name)
#
sets:
  # train/test/validate : only listed sets will be rendered
  
  train:
    # each task is a separate selection
    # of voices/heads/rooms needed to render a scene.
    # if you want to render each scene with default values
    # leave the voices/heads/rooms empty and the one
    # specified in the recipe will be used.
  
    # for voice/heads/rooms specification do not add the ".yaml"
    # use only filename without extention

    tasks:
      # note: if multiple voices are listed they will be used 
      #       according to the scene requirements, matching is done "in sorting order". 
      #       listing more voices than what is required by the scene will not have effects (skipped)

# script hooks & lib import for data preparation (optional)

hooks:
# t.b.d (still needed to define syntax)
# the idea is to allow pre and post processing, like for example 
# to add "analog pink noise" to the rendering and simulate
# analog mic "hissing"
# note: we might need to move this "inside" the task level definition
