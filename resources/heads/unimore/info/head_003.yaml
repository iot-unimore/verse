#
# HRTFs definition:
# we can have more than one HRTF for the same head because the 3DTuneIn tool will
# take only binaural hrtf for rendering. For this head we have multiple micropones
# arranged in L/R pairs (for binaural and for glasses array).
# we list them in order with the associated hrtf file.
